### Required Repositories and File Structure for Development

Five repositories make up the source code of the IMS Logger.
* [imslogger-compose](https://github.com/IntegratedMillSystems/imslogger-compose)
* [imslogger-logger](https://github.com/IntegratedMillSystems/imslogger-logger)
* [imslogger-py](https://github.com/IntegratedMillSystems/imslogger-py)
* [pyconpro](https://github.com/IntegratedMillSystems/pyconpro)
* [imslogger-webinterface](https://github.com/IntegratedMillSystems/imslogger-webinterface)

The current file structure required for development is not ideal. Several repositories
must be cloned and in some cases renamed before the software can be built.

Below is the required file structure. The source repository of each folder is given
in parentheses.

<DisplayFileStructure>
  <Folder name="Project Root">
    <Folder name="compose_files" altName="imslogger-compose" />
    <Folder name="logger" altName="imslogger-logger">
      <Folder name="lib">
        <Folder name="imslogger" altName="imslogger-logger" />
        <Folder name="pyconpro" altName="pyconpro" />
      </Folder>
    </Folder>
    <Folder name="webinterface" altName="imslogger-webinterface" />
  </Folder>
</DisplayFileStructure>

Note that the *lib* folder has no source repository; instead it has two repositories
nested inside of it. After cloning imslogger-logger, this lib folder must be created
(it is in the *.gitignore* file of the repository), and then the two nested repositories must be cloned
inside of it.

## Building and Running the project

Building and running the project is fairly easy, but it's easy to forget.

### Building

To build the project, both the frontend and the backend (the docker images) must be
built.

<Tabs
  groupId="env"
  defaultValue="prod"
  values={[
    {label: "Production", value: "prod"},
    {label: "Development", value: "dev"}
  ]}>
<TabItem value="prod">

**Build the Frontend:** run `npm run build` in the */webinterface/frontend* directory

**Build the docker images:** run the build script (`./build`) in *./compose_files/imslogger/*

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="dev">

**Build the Frontend:** run `npm run dev` in the *./webinterface/frontend* directory.

**Build the docker images:** run the build script (`./build`) in *./compose_files/imslogger_dev/*

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


### Running

<Tabs
  groupId="env"
  defaultValue="prod"
  values={[
    {label: "Production", value: "prod"},
    {label: "Development", value: "dev"}
  ]}>
<TabItem value="prod">

Run `docker-compose up` in the *./compose_files/imslogger/* directory.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="dev">

Run `docker-compose up` in the *./compose_files/imslogger_dev/* directory.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### VSCode Tasks

Alternatively, you can use the VSCode tasks in [this](/files/tasks_json.txt) file.
