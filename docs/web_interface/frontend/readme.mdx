## The Panels

The goal of this frontend is to allow users to start logs, stop logs, and analyse
the data that is produced easily. To achieve this, the frontend has been separated into
four panels: the Live View panel, the Active Processes panel, the Logs panel, and
the Analyze panel.

### The Live View Panel

In the Live View panel, users can connect with PLCs, see the data their tags contain,
and start logs.

### The Active Processes Panel

This panel allows users to see what loggers are currently running on the IMS Logger.
If necessary, the loggers can also be stopped from this panel.

### The Logs Panel

The Logs panel allows users to view and search for logs. There are two search modes:
one is basic and one is advanced.

The **basic search mode** uses one, general search term. That term could apply to
any of the following fields: the PLC address, the tag name, and the
column names.

The **advanced search mode** allows users to refine their search by using separate
terms for each field. It also makes it possible to search by date or a range of dates and
use Regex.

### The Analyze Panel

Using the Analyze panel, it will be possible to create custom plots and calculate
statistics with existing logs. Custom plots are grouped in to views, which are named
and stored in a file-like structure.
