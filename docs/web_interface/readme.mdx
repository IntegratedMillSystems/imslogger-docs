The web interface for the IMS Logger is build using Django. Within the Django project,
there are five apps. Four of those are APIs.

* The **LoggerAPI**, which connects the frontend with the backend server.
* The **LogsAPI**, which provides opperations for reading logs.
* The **LiveAPI**, which connects the frontend directly to PLCs
* The **ViewsAPI**, which provides opperations for reading and writing views. Views
are custom pages that display log data, calculated columns, and statistics.

The fifth app is the **frontend**, which uses React to create a dynamic user
interface.




## Configuration

To control the configuration
of Django, use the following environment variables.
* `DEBUG`
* `DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS`

Configuration that is not dependant on the environment (production or development)
can be done in the *./WebInterface/settings.py* file.
