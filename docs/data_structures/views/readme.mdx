Views are stored in the `views` collection (along with [folders](view-folders))
and are structured as follows.

```json
{
  _id: <ObjectId>,
  parent: <ObjectId> or "root",

  name: <string>,
  type: "view" (as opposed to "folder"),

  plots: [
    {
      logs: [
        {id: <ObjectId>, tags: [<tag id>, <tag id>, ...]},
        ...
      ]
    },
    ...
  ],
  
  stats: [], // TBD

  created_at: <Date>,
  updated_at: <Date>
}
```
