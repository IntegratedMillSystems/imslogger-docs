title: Logs

Logs are stored in the `logs` collection, and are structured as follows.

```json
{
  _id: <ObjectId>,
  
  plc: <string>,
  tag: <string>,
  
  start: <Date>,
  stop: <Date>,

  columns: [
    { // One DateTime column, always at the beginning
      type: "DateTime",
      name: "DateTime",
    },
    { // Then the rest of the columns
      type: "BOOL" or "REAL," etc.
      name: <string>
    },
    ...
  ],
  entries: [
    {DateTime: <Date>, <col_name>: <col_value>, ...},
    ...
  ]
}
```

## _id

The `_id` field is a BSON ObjectId.

## plc

The `plc` field is a string set to the address of the plc the log was taken from.
It must follow the format of a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address followed
by a forward slash and its slot number.

E.g. `192.168.1.2/0`

This slot number is manditory. If the user does not provide one, the frontend
must append a `/0` to the address for passing to the API.

## tag
The `tag` field is stores the name of the tag the data was logged from.

## start
The DateTime recorded at the beginning of the log.

## stop
The DateTime recorded after the log is stopped (gracefully).

## columns
The `columns` field is an array representing the variables and variable types
provided by the tag being logged.

Each item of this array must have a `name` field and a `type` field. Currently,
the following types are supported.

:::caution
Not all of these `type` fields have been tested yet.
:::

| `type` | C Type | Size | Plot Type (on the frontend) |
|--------------|------|------|------------------------|
| BOOL | bool | 1 bit | Bool Plot |
| DINT | long int |4 bytes | Float Plot |
| INT  | int | 2 bytes | Float Plot |
| LINT | long long int | 8 bytes | Float Plot |
| LREAL | double | 8 bytes | Float Plot |
| REAL | float | 4 bytes | Float Plot |
| SINT | short int| 2 bytes | Float Plot |
| UDINT | unsigned long int | 4 bytes | Float Plot |
| UINT | unsigned int | 4 bytes | Float Plot |
| ULINT | unsigned long long int | 8 bytes | Float Plot |
| USINT | unsigned short int | 2 bytes | Float Plot |

## entries
The `entries` field is the body of the log. It's an array of the data taken from
the PLC.

The fields of each item in this array must match to the `name` fields of
the columns.
