The **imslogger-py** library takes the data provided by the PyConPro library,
parses it, and saves it to a MongoDB database. It does this using two threads; one
to parse the data and push it to a queue and one to take the data from queue and
write it to the database.

Parsing the data is particularly complicated. Before the consumer connection is started,
a third party library is used to get the fields and datatypes of that column. Then,
an **address dictionary** is created for the parser instance as a reference. Once
the consumer starts, the parser instance uses the address dictionary to parse the
bytestring it recieves from consumer connection (through PyConPro).

## Usage Guide

To start a **logger**, we must first start a connection with a PLC (see the docs
for PyConPro for more details).

```python
from pyconpro import Connection
con = Connection()
myPlc = con.addPLC("172.16.13.200")
```

Now we can create and start a logger.

```python
myLogger = Logger(
  myPlc,
  "test", # Tag name
  readinterval=1, # Time between data points (in seconds)
  writeinterval=5, # Time between writes to the database (in seconds)
  db_name="my_log_db"
)
myLogger.Start()
```

:::warning
Currently, `imslogger-py` is only compatiable with Mongo databases accessible through
the network address `mongodb`. This is standard for MongoDB docker images.
:::

:::caution
As with PyConPro, the tag you request data from must be configured to allow consumer
connections.

That's it. If all goes well, data will start populating you Mongo database. To learn
more about the format of the log this logger produces, see the
[Data Structures entry for logs](/docs/data_structures/logs).
