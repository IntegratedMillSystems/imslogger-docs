**PyConPro** is a python library that allows us to make multiple consumer connections
with multiple PLCs. At some point we would also like to add a feature allowing
producer connections, but we don't know when that will happen.

This library has three main classes: **Connection**, **PLC**, and **Consumer**.
Each of these are responsible for a different part of the Consumer/Producer protocol.

## Usage Guide

In order to start a connection with any PLC, an instance of the Connection class
must be created and then started.

```python
con = Connection()
con.Start()
```

Then, we can add a plc using the `addPLC` function.

```python
myPlc = con.addPLC("172.16.13.200", slot=0)
```

To start a Consumer/Producer, we first need to define the `ConsumerHint`.

```python
myHint = ConsumerHint(tag="test", datasize=6, rpi=1000, otrpi=1100)
```

* Set `tag` to the name of the tag you would like to log.
* Set `datasize` to the bytesize of the tag.
* Set `rpi` to your desired delay between data points (in milliseconds).
* Set `otrpi` to a number slightly higher than you `rpi`. *(More documentation needed)*

:::important
The `datasize` field must include an extra 2 bytes for the header.

I.e. if the tag has 4 bytes of data, set `datasize` to 6.
:::


:::tip Common Issues
Before logging, make sure the tag is configured to accept a Consumer/Producer connection.
:::

We also need to provide our consumer a function to handle the data we recieve.
```python
def handler(bytedata):
  print(bytedata)
```

Now, we initialize and start the consumer.

```python
myConsumer = myPlc.addConsumer(myHint, handler)
myConsumer.Start()
```

You should get an output that looks something like this:

```bash
b'\x00\x00HB'
b'\x00\x00HB'
b'\x00\x00HB'
b'\x00\x00HB'
b'\x00\x00HB'
b'\x00\x00HB'
...
```

To stop the consumer, call `myConsumer.Stop()`.

## Full Example

Here's a full example showing it's possible to log more than one tag at a time.

```python
from pyconpro import Connection, ConsumerHint
from time import sleep

con = Connection()
myplc = con.addPLC("172.16.13.200")

def handler1(data):
    print("My first consumer: ", data)

def handler2(data):
    print("My second consumer: ", data)

con.Start()

myhint = ConsumerHint(tag="test", datasize=6, rpi=1000, otrpi=1100)
myconsumer = myplc.addConsumer(myhint, handler1)
myconsumer.Start()

sleep(0.3)

myhint2 = ConsumerHint(tag="test2", datasize=6, rpi=1000, otrpi=1100)
myconsumer2 = myplc.addConsumer(myhint2, handler2)
myconsumer2.Start()

con.Join()
con.Close()
```

## The Please Reset Error

If, after all consumers with a particular PLC are stopped, another consumer connection
with that PLC is started, a `PleaseResetError` may be thrown. This could occur for
two reasons:
* The PLC stopped listening
* An unhandled part of the Consumer/Producer protocol was used. This particular
issue can happen if a consumer is started to soon after all of the other consumers
for a particular PLC were stopped.

If either of these issues are encountered, just try to start the consumer again.

**Note:** this solution is abstracted away by the server.
