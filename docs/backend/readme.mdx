The backend of IMS Logger has three main components.

* **PyConPro**, which communicates with PLCs using the EtherNet/IP Producer/Consumer
protocol
* **imslogger-py**, which parses and logs (stores) the data obtained through PyConPro
* **The Server**, which handles logging requests and instances of the logger within imslogger-py.

When the docker images are built, these three components combine into one docker
image; PyConPro and imslogger-py are installed as python libraries, and the server
script is set as the entry point for the image.

However, their source code is stored in three separate repositories:
[pyconpro](https://github.com/IntegratedMillSystems/pyconpro),
[imslogger-py](https://github.com/IntegratedMillSystems/imslogger-py), and
[imslogger-logger](https://github.com/IntegratedMillSystems/imslogger-logger)
respectively. Because of this, and because they function separately, their documentation
has been broken into three sections.
