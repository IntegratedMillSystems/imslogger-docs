The backend server of the IMS Logger uses PyConPro and imslogger-py to start and
stop logs.

It can be communicated with asychronosly using a TCP connection on the port set
by the environment variable `IMSLOGGER_SERVICE_PORT` (the default is 56561).
See the [API page](api) for more details.

The Mongo Database that the server will log data to can be set using the environment
variable `IMSLOGGER_DBNAME`.
