In order to make installation as easy as possible, the IMS Logger Server is provided as a Raspberry Pi disk image . If you'd like to set the server up on a different machine, see the [Custom Installation](custom-install) section.

## Installing the Server on a Raspberry Pi

First, get the disk image of the lastest release, which can be found at https://github.com/imslogger/imslogger-server/releases under "assets".

Then, flash that image onto your Raspberry Pi's SD card. We like to use [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) to do this. Once the SD card has been flashed, you should be able to boot up the Pi with a fresh installation of the IMS Logger Server.
