Welcome to the documentation for the IMS Logger!

The IMS Logger is a stand-alone device that logs and displays data from
[Programmable Logic Controllers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_logic_controller)
(or PLCs), devices which are commonly used to store sensor data and control
machines on factory floors.

The IMS Logger is designed to be easily installable. It runs on
, and plug-and-play disk images
will be provided, and for those who . It is also designed to be easily accessible.

In order to recieve data quickly and reliably, it also takes advantage of the
[EtherNet/IP Consumer/Producer protocol](https://www.odva.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/PUB00138R6-Tech-Series-EtherNetIP.pdf).
This allows our device to log data at speeds of up to 1000 data points per second.

## Architechure

The intent of this project was to run IMS Logger on a
[Raspberry Pi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi). However, since it is
built using [Docker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)), the
application could theoretically run on any docker-supporting (most likely Unix) device.

The production build of IMS Logger uses four docker images.
* A standard MongoDB docker image.
* A Nginx image for reliably serving the web interface (slightly modified)
* A custom alpine linux image running a python server
* A custom alpine linux image running Django

The development build uses all of these except the Nginx image.

### Orchestration using Docker-Compose

IMS Logger starts and stops using
[docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), a tool which allows the
configuration of multiple docker containers using a *docker-compose.yml* file.

The configuration for the production and development builds can found in *./imslogger*
and *./imslogger_dev* directories (respectively) of the
[imslogger-compose](https://github.com/IntegratedMillSystems/imslogger-compose)
repository.
